# Interactive Numerical Calculus Learning Tool ðŸ§®

An interactive desktop application built with Python to help students visualize and understand fundamental concepts of numerical calculus. The tool provides hands-on demonstrations of error analysis, root-finding methods, and techniques for solving linear systems, all within a modern, user-friendly interface.

-----

## Features âœ¨

The application is organized into three main modules, each targeting a core area of numerical calculus.

### **1. NoÃ§Ãµes de Erro (Notions of Error) ðŸŽ“**

  * **Floating-Point Analysis:** Input any decimal number and see its binary representation according to the **IEEE 754 standard** for both single (32-bit) and double (64-bit) precision. The tool breaks down the representation into its sign, exponent, and mantissa, and shows the actual decimal value stored to highlight representation errors.
  * **Truncation Error Visualization:** See how a Taylor series approximates functions like $sin(x)$, $cos(x)$, and $e^x$. Interactively change the number of terms and see the approximation, errors (absolute and relative), and a plot comparing the real function to its polynomial approximation.

-----

### **2. Zeros de FunÃ§Ãµes (Zeros of Functions) ðŸŽ¯**

  * **Bisection Method:** Input a function, an interval $[a, b]$, and a tolerance. The tool provides a step-by-step table of iterations and visually plots the function, highlighting how the interval converges on the root at each step.
  * **Newton-Raphson Method:** Input a function and an initial guess. The application symbolically computes the derivative, displays a detailed iteration table, and plots the function along with the **tangent line** at each step to show how the next approximation is found.

-----

### **3. Sistemas Lineares (Linear Systems) ðŸ”¢**

  * **Gaussian Elimination:** Enter a matrix `A` and vector `b` into a dynamic grid. The tool demonstrates the step-by-step process of forward elimination (with optional **partial pivoting**) and back substitution to find the solution vector `x`.
  * **Ill-Conditioned Systems:** Load a classic ill-conditioned system (like a Hilbert matrix) to understand sensitivity. Make a tiny change in the vector `b` and observe the dramatic change in the solution `x`, reinforced by the calculated **condition number**.
  * **Gauss-Seidel Method:** Solve systems iteratively. The tool checks for diagonal dominance and shows the solution vector converging at each step until the desired tolerance is met.

## Tech Stack ðŸ’»

  * **Language:** Python 3
  * **GUI:** CustomTkinter
  * **Numerical Operations:** NumPy
  * **Plotting:** Matplotlib
  * **Symbolic Mathematics:** SymPy
