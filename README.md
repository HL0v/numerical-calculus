# Interactive Numerical Calculus Learning Tool 🧮

An interactive desktop application built with Python to help students visualize and understand fundamental concepts of numerical calculus. The tool provides hands-on demonstrations of error analysis, root-finding methods, linear systems, interpolation, curve fitting, and numerical integration, all within a modern, user-friendly interface.

-----

## Features ✨

The application is organized into six main modules, targeting core areas of numerical calculus.

### **1. Noções de Erro (Notions of Error) 🎓**
* **Floating-Point Analysis:** Input any decimal number and see its binary representation according to the **IEEE 754 standard** (32-bit and 64-bit). Break down the sign, exponent, and mantissa to visualize representation errors.
* **Truncation Error Visualization:** Approximate functions like $sin(x)$, $cos(x)$, and $e^x$ using Taylor series. Interactively change the number of terms and observe the absolute and relative errors alongside a visual plot.

### **2. Zeros de Funções (Zeros of Functions) 🎯**
* **Bisection Method:** Step-by-step iteration table and visualization of the interval converging on the root.
* **Newton-Raphson Method:** Symbolic derivative computation, iteration table, and tangent line visualization at each step.
